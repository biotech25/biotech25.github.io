I am a postdoctoral researcher in [Osmanbeyoglu Lab](http://osmanbeyoglulab.com/) at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. My current research focus is on developing statistical and mathematical models for single cell multi-omics integration.

Before joining UPMC, I received a Ph.D. in Mathematical Sciences from Carnegie Mellon University and a B.S. in Mathematical Sciences from Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
