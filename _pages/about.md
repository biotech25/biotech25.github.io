I am a postdoctoral researcher at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Department of Biomedical Informatics, in [Osmanbeyoglu Lab] (http://osmanbeyoglulab.com/). My current research focus is on statistical and mathematical models for single cell multi-omics integration.

Before joining UPMC, I received a Ph.D. in Mathematical Sciences from Carnegie Mellon University and a B.S. in Mathematical Sciences from Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
